This ensures that any publicly accessible systems and components are physically and logically separated from the bank's internal networks (WAN and LAN). &para;<br>&para;<br>This is primarily achieved via the effective use of various technologies such as; firewalls, IDS/IPS, and VLANs. These together constitute the establishment of a demilitarized zone(s) (DMZ), which allows the bank to only expose publically accessible services to the internet in a responsible manner. &para;<br>&para;<br>Direct access to the bank's internal systems and services via the internet is properly segmented, policy enforced, restricted, and monitored on a continuous basis.&para;<br>&para;<br>Enforcement of the DMZ's is solely maintained by Checkpoint Software and Palo Alto Networks. Checkpoint policies/zones manage ingress web traffic and Palo Alto policies/zones manage egress network traffic; both solutions enforce the concept of perimeter network segmentation between untrusted (internet) and trusted (bank) networks.&para;<br>&para;<br>In terms of "microsegmentation" the bank utilizes Illumio technology. This use of this control started with segmenting SWIFT, what the bank calls the "SecureZone."  This same use of Illumio has been extended to other financial applications as well and continues to expand. This includes SWIFT, ACEP, PSD2, ONE SPAN, PSD2 GEO, PSD2 COUCHDB, PSD2 Digital with EBICS, SAM, WAS-Cluster, FRAUD-AIS, etc..&para;<br>&para;<br>In FY22, the "Network Segmentation Discovery" project completed (as per the document "Network Segmentation discovery effort -Final") and this describes a bank strategy to incorporate the use of network segmentation in a phased approach to meet various defined use-cases which a key focus to address specific risk areas associated with:&para;<br>&para;<br>* Mitigation of Lateral Movement&para;<br>* The spread of Ransomware&para;<br>* Insider Threat&para;<br>&para;<br>The first phase of this effort is focused on Lateral Movement for bank workstations, which address the conditions associated with Lateral Movement and the spread of Ransomware. This includes the rollout of Illumio VEN agents to all managed SBMC desktops throughout the AD (which is to include the Group Companies).
